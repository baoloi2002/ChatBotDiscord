Daddy Pig," Now, now. You two big girls are meant to be teaching Richard and George to play nicely together."
Rebecca Rabbit, That’s right. We’re big girls.
Peppa Pig, And George and Richard are too little to play together properly.

Daddy Pig, That’s it. Easy as pie!
Daddy Pig, Ooo!
Mummy Pig, Do these pegs do anything?
Daddy Pig," Of course, I forgot about the pegs."
Narrator, Pegs hold the tent up.
Daddy Pig, There.
Peppa Pig, The tent is a bit little.
Daddy Pig," It was big enough for me when I was a boy, but it does look a bit small now!"
Mummy Pig," That’s because you’ve grown a bit since you were a boy, Daddy Pig."
Peppa Pig, And your tummy has grown the most of all!

Peppa Pig, What is that?
Mummy Pig," That’s an owl. Look, there it is."
Peppa and George, Wow.
Peppa Pig, And what’s that noise?
Mummy Pig," Oh, I’m not sure."
Peppa Pig, It’s Daddy’s tummy!
Daddy Pig, My tummy rumbling is one of the best sounds of nature. It means it’s time to eat.
Peppa Pig, I love tomato soup.
Daddy Pig, So do I!
Mummy Pig, There’s another one of Daddy Pig’s sounds of nature.
Daddy Pig, What?
Mummy Pig," Come on, children. Into the tent. It’s bedtime."

Daddy Pig, It will be fine. In you go.
Daddy Pig," Move further in, Mummy Pig!"

Daddy Pig, Never mind. I’d rather sleep outside anyway!
Mummy Pig," Good night, Daddy Pig."
Peppa Pig," Good night, Daddy."
George, Night-night~!
Daddy Pig," Good night, everyone."
Narrator," Mummy Pig, Peppa and George are sleeping in the tent. Daddy Pig is sleeping outside under the stars."

Peppa Pig," Daddy, Where have you been?"

Daddy Pig, Oh no.
Peppa Pig," But don't worry, Daddy. I’ll make sure you do it."
Daddy Pig," Yes, I know you will. (Chuckles)"
Narrator," Daddy Pig wears glasses. He needs to wear glasses to see clearly. When Daddy Pig wears his glasses, everything looks fine. But when Daddy Pig takes his glasses off, he can’t see things clearly. Everything looks a bit soft and fuzzy. So it is very important that Daddy Pig knows where his glasses are."
Narrator, Sometimes Daddy Pig loses his glasses.
Mummy Pig," Peppa, George, have you seen Daddy Pig’s glasses? He can’t find them anywhere."
Peppa Pig," No, Mummy."
Narrator, Peppa and George do not know where Daddy Pig’s glasses are.
Mummy Pig," Oh, dear. Daddy Pig cannot see a thing without them. And it makes him very grumpy."
Narrator," Without his glasses on, Daddy Pig cannot read his newspaper."
Daddy Pig, This is ridiculous. I can’t see anything. Somebody must have put my glasses somewhere.
Mummy Pig," Do you remember where you last put them, Daddy Pig?"
Daddy Pig, When I don’t wear them I always put them in my pocket. But they aren’t there now.
Peppa Pig," Daddy, can we help find your glasses?"
Mummy Pig," Good idea, Peppa. If you find them, Daddy will stop being so grumpy."
Daddy Pig, I’m not grumpy.
Narrator, Peppa and George are looking for Daddy’s glasses.

Narrator, Peppa and George cannot find Daddy Pig’s glasses anywhere.
Peppa Pig, We’ve looked everywhere but we can’t find Daddy’s glasses.
Mummy Pig," Oh, dear. Now what can we do?"
Daddy Pig, I suppose I‘ll just have to learn to do without them. If I move slowly I won’t bump into things.
Peppa Pig, There they are. Daddy’s glasses.
Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig. You were sitting on them all the time.
Daddy Pig, Oh.
Peppa Pig, Silly Daddy.
Daddy Pig, I don’t know how they got there.
Mummy Pig, I wonder how.
Mummy Pig," Well you may have been a bit silly, Daddy Pig, but at least you’re not grumpy anymore."

The Queen," Hello, everyone!"
Children," Hello, Queen!"
Peppa Pig, We're visiting London for the day!
Miss Rabbit, We were hoping you could tell us the best places to see.
The Queen," I can do better than that! After all, London is my city. I'll give you a guided tour myself."
Children, Horray!
The Queen, The best way to see London is on a double-decker bus.
All, Ooh!
The Queen," Mr. Driver, please may we borrow your bus?"
 Driver, Borrow my bus? You must be joking!
The Queen, No. I am your Queen.

Narrator," If the Queen asks you to do something, you must do it!"
 Driver, Everyone up to the top deck!
Peppa Pig, The bus has stairs in it!
Narrator, The double-decker bus has seats at the top!

The Queen, You know a lot for a little elephant.
Edmond Elephant, I'm a clever clogs.
The Queen, Oh.
Danny Dog, That was loud!
The Queen," That is the sound of Big Ben telling us the time. It rang three times, so it is 3:00."
Wendy Wolf," If it rang six times, would that make it 6:00?"
The Queen," Yes, it would."
Pedro Pony, And if it rang 100 times?
The Queen," Then it would be broken. On with the tour! Next stop, Tower Bridge! We need to cross the bridge to continue the tour."

Peppa Pig, Look! There's a big ship! It's going to bang into the bridge!
Peppa Pig, The bridge is lifting up!
All, Wow!
Narrator, Tower Bridge lifs to let tall ships sail through.
The Queen," Good. Now the ship has passed, we can be on our way. Please lower the bridge."

All, Whee!
Narrator, The bus is balancing on the bridge.
Miss Rabbit," Now, what do we do?"
The Queen," Hang on a minute, lads, I've got a great idea. Everybody move to the front of the bus."
All, Okay!
Children, Horray!
Narrator, The Queen is good at driving buses.
The Queen," Are you enjoying your tour, children?"
Children, Yes!
Peppa Pig, Open-top buses are the best!

Narrator," Here is Rebecca Rabbit with her little brother, Richard Rabbit."
Rebecca Rabbit," Hello, everyone."
 Suzy Sheep and Danny Dog, Hello.
Rebecca Rabbit, Can I come on the roundabout too?
Daddy Pig," Hop on, Rebecca."
Rebecca Rabbit, Let’s go really really fast.
Narrator, Richard Rabbit wants to go on the roundabout too.
Peppa Pig," Oh, if Richard gets on, it means we can’t go fast."
Rebecca Rabbit, Richard can play with George.
Mummy Rabbit," Richard, would you like to play with George?"
Richard, No.
Mummy Rabbit, George has a dinosaur just like yours. Let’s go and see.
Narrator, Richard Rabbit is the same age as George.
Mummy Rabbit, Richard wants to see George’s dinosaur.

George, (giggles)
Narrator, Richard does not like sharing either.
Daddy Pig, What’s all this crying about?
Peppa Pig, George and Richard always cry when they play together.
Rebecca Rabbit, They’re just too little to play properly.

Peppa Pig, Of course.
Rebecca Rabbit, We can help them make sand castles.
Daddy Pig, Good idea. Let’s go to the sand pit.
Narrator, George and Richard love the sand pit.
Peppa Pig," George, Richard, today we are going to make sand castles."

Peppa Pig, Hey presto.
Narrator, Richard has made a sand castle.
George, Hey presto.
Narrator, And George has made a sand castle.
Daddy Pig," You see, playing together is fun."
Narrator," Oh, dear. This game has not gone very well."
Peppa Pig, It was your brother’s fault. He broke George’s sand castle.
Rebecca Rabbit, Your brother broke my brother’s sand castle first.
Daddy Pig," Now, now. You two big girls are meant to be teaching Richard and George to play nicely together."
Rebecca Rabbit, That’s right. We’re big girls.
Peppa Pig, And George and Richard are too little to play together properly.
Mummy Pig, Hmm. I’ve got an idea.
Mummy Pig," George, what’s your most favourite thing in the whole playground?"
George, Seesaw.
Narrator, George loves the seesaw.
George, Seesaw.
Narrator, It is a bit difficult to play on a seesaw on your own.

Daddy Pig," How lovely. Ssh, ssh little birdy! We can't hear our TV"
Mummy Pig," Oh Daddy Pig, there's no point in being on a camping holiday and just watching TV. We can do that at home."
Daddy Pig, Err... Good thinking Mummy Pig.
Mummy Pig, There are lots of fun places we can visit. There's tree world.
Peppa, What's tree world?
Mummy Pig, Tree world is a big forrest full of trees.
Peppa, It sounds a bit boring.
Mummy Pig, Or there's potato city.
Peppa, What's potato city?
Mummy Pig, There's a tour of the potato fields ending with a potato tasting.

Mummy Pig, Or there's duck land.
Peppa, What's duck land?
Mummy Pig, It's a wide river full of ducks.
Peppa, Duck land! Let's go to duck land!
Narrator, Peppa and George love ducks.
Peppa, How do we get to duck land?

Peppa, Goodnight!
Narrator, Peppa and her family are going camping.
Daddy Pig, I love camping. We’re here!
Daddy Pig," Peppa, George, this is the tent I had when I was a little boy."
Peppa Pig," Daddy, how are you going to make that into a tent?"
Daddy Pig," Don’t worry, Peppa. I’m an expert at camping! Mummy Pig, put the tent on the poles, please."
Daddy Pig, That’s it. Easy as pie!
Daddy Pig, Ooo!
Mummy Pig, Do these pegs do anything?
Daddy Pig," Of course, I forgot about the pegs."
Narrator, Pegs hold the tent up.
Daddy Pig, There.
Peppa Pig, The tent is a bit little.
Daddy Pig," It was big enough for me when I was a boy, but it does look a bit small now!"
Mummy Pig," That’s because you’ve grown a bit since you were a boy, Daddy Pig."
Peppa Pig, And your tummy has grown the most of all!
Daddy Pig," Talking of tummies, we should cook supper."
Peppa Pig," Yes, yes!"
Daddy Pig, First we have to collect sticks to make a fire.
Peppa Pig, Yippee~!
Narrator, Peppa and George are helping Daddy Pig collect sticks for the campfire.
Peppa Pig," George, I’ll pick up the sticks and you can carry them."
Peppa Pig, Collecting sticks is fun!
Daddy Pig," Good, that’s enough sticks."
Daddy Pig, That’s a splendid campfire. Now I’ll light it.
Mummy Pig, Here are the matches!
Daddy Pig, We don’t need matches.
Peppa Pig," Daddy, how can you light it without matches?"
Daddy Pig, I’m going to make fire the old way. By simply rubbing these two sticks together.
Narrator, Daddy Pig is rubbing the two sticks together to light the campfire.
Peppa Pig," Where’s the fire, Daddy?"
Daddy Pig, Nearly there.
 Mummy Pig and George, Hurrah!
Daddy Pig, Easy as pie.
Mummy Pig, Now we can heat up the tomato soup.
Daddy Pig," Ah, listen to the sounds of nature."
Peppa Pig, What is that sound?
Daddy Pig, That is the sound of crickets chirping.
Peppa Pig, What is that?
Mummy Pig," That’s an owl. Look, there it is."
Peppa and George, Wow.
Peppa Pig, And what’s that noise?
Mummy Pig," Oh, I’m not sure."
Peppa Pig, It’s Daddy’s tummy!
Daddy Pig, My tummy rumbling is one of the best sounds of nature. It means it’s time to eat.
Peppa Pig, I love tomato soup.
Daddy Pig, So do I!
Mummy Pig, There’s another one of Daddy Pig’s sounds of nature.
Daddy Pig, What?
Mummy Pig," Come on, children. Into the tent. It’s bedtime."
Peppa Pig, We won’t all fit in. The tent is too little.
Daddy Pig, It will be fine. In you go.
Daddy Pig," Move further in, Mummy Pig!"
Peppa Pig," Daddy, you’re too big for the tent."
Daddy Pig, Never mind. I’d rather sleep outside anyway!
Mummy Pig," Good night, Daddy Pig."
Peppa Pig," Good night, Daddy."
George, Night-night~!
Daddy Pig," Good night, everyone."
Narrator," Mummy Pig, Peppa and George are sleeping in the tent. Daddy Pig is sleeping outside under the stars."
Daddy Pig," I love camping, sleeping in the open air with the stars above me."
Daddy Pig, Maybe this wasn’t such a good idea after all...
Narrator, It is morning.
Peppa Pig," Daddy, it was lovely and cosy in the tent. Oh, where’s Daddy?"
Narrator, Daddy Pig has gone.
Mummy Pig, Poor Daddy Pig. He must have been cold and wet! And now where is he?

Peppa Pig, It sounds like snoring...
Peppa Pig, Daddy Pig!
Daddy Pig, What?
Peppa Pig," Daddy, you’re safe!"

Daddy Pig, Ah. I love watching telly. (Thud and bump)
Daddy Pig, What's this Mummy Pig?
Mummy Pig, (oinks) It's a programme about doing exercises to keep fit.
Daddy Pig, (chuckles) Thank goodness I don't have to exercise. I'm naturally fit.
Peppa Pig, (oinks) You don't look very fit Daddy. Your tummy is a bit big.
Daddy Pig, I'm very fit. I'll show you. (Oinks) What shall I do first?
Peppa Pig, Touch your toes like this.
Daddy Pig, Easy. (straining)
Peppa Pig," Daddy, stop pretending that you can't touch your toes."

Peppa Pig," Yes, Daddy."
Daddy Pig, And I will start... tomorrow. (Thud and bump)
Mummy Pig," Daddy Pig, you have to start exercising now."
Daddy Pig, Oh.
Peppa Pig, Don't worry Daddy. I will help you.
Daddy Pig," Oh, all right."
Daddy Pig," Peppa, you're in charge of getting me fit. What shall I do first?"
Peppa Pig, First you must do some press-ups.
Daddy Pig, (oinks) Easy.
Peppa Pig, One. Two.
Daddy Pig, There.
Peppa Pig," Very good, Daddy. Now I want you to do.... one hundred."
Daddy Pig, One hundred?
Peppa Pig, Yes.
Mummy Pig," Come on, children. Help me make lunch."
Daddy Pig, I'll help as well.
Peppa Pig," No, Daddy. You've got one hundred press-ups to do."
Daddy Pig," Oh. One, two... 3, 4..."
Narrator," Mummy Pig, Peppa and George are in the kitchen making lunch. Daddy pig: 5...."
Daddy Pig, Six...
Narrator, Daddy Pig is still doing his press-ups. Daddy pig: 7....
Daddy Pig, Eight...
Peppa Pig, Daddy is doing very well.
Daddy Pig, 9...
Daddy Pig, Ten...
Mummy Pig," Yes, I do hope he's not overdoing it. Daddy pig: 11... 12..."
Peppa Pig, I'll go and see.
Daddy Pig," Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen."
Peppa Pig," Daddy Pig! You're cheating, you should be doing press-ups."
Daddy Pig," Oh, er, there was something interesting on the TV."
Peppa Pig, Naughty Daddy.
Mummy Pig, Maybe Daddy will have more success with my old exercise bike.
Daddy Pig, Ah ha. This looks like fun. I'll be able to cycle and watch TV at the same time. (Engine sounds)
Daddy Pig, It's impossible. This bike is too noisy. I can't hear the TV.
Mummy Pig, (oinks) You've got to get fit somehow.
Peppa Pig," I know, you can use my bicycle."
Mummy Pig," Yes, and then you'll get some fresh air as well."
Narrator, Daddy Pig is going to ride on Peppa's little bicycle.
Peppa Pig," Daddy, these are the pedals, these are the brakes, and this is the bell. (Bells ring)"
Daddy Pig," Yes, yes, thank you, Peppa. I know. (Oinks) Bye-bye. (Bells ring)"
Daddy Pig, Easy as pie. Ough. (Panting)
Narrator, Getting fit is quite hard work.
Daddy Pig," Ahh. Oh ho, Now I can get fit without having to pedal. (Bells ringing)"
Narrator, Daddy Pig is going very fast.
Daddy Pig, Oh. Maybe I'd better slow down.
Daddy Pig, (screams) The brakes aren't strong enough! Help! (screaming)
Daddy Pig, Whoa!
Narrator, Daddy Pig has been gone for a long time.
Peppa Pig," Mummy, where can Daddy be?"
Mummy Pig," Don't worry, Peppa. Daddy must be really enjoying himself to be away for so long."
Daddy Pig," Ough, ough, hagh, egh. (Panting and tired) (The duck quacks) (bells ring)"
Peppa Pig," Daddy, Where have you been?"
Daddy Pig, I whizzed all the way down the hill. Then I had to push the bike all the way back up again.
Mummy Pig," (Gasps) Oh, poor Daddy Pig."
Daddy Pig, Well at least I've done my exercise.
Mummy Pig," Yes, for today."
Daddy Pig, What do you mean?
Mummy Pig, You have to do some more exercise tomorrow.
Daddy Pig, What?
Peppa Pig," Daddy, to get fit, you have to exercise every day."
Daddy Pig, Oh no.
Peppa Pig," But don't worry, Daddy. I’ll make sure you do it."
Daddy Pig," Yes, I know you will. (Chuckles)"
Narrator," Daddy Pig wears glasses. He needs to wear glasses to see clearly. When Daddy Pig wears his glasses, everything looks fine. But when Daddy Pig takes his glasses off, he can’t see things clearly. Everything looks a bit soft and fuzzy. So it is very important that Daddy Pig knows where his glasses are."
Narrator, Sometimes Daddy Pig loses his glasses.
Mummy Pig," Peppa, George, have you seen Daddy Pig’s glasses? He can’t find them anywhere."
Peppa Pig," No, Mummy."
Narrator, Peppa and George do not know where Daddy Pig’s glasses are.
Mummy Pig," Oh, dear. Daddy Pig cannot see a thing without them. And it makes him very grumpy."
Narrator," Without his glasses on, Daddy Pig cannot read his newspaper."
Daddy Pig, This is ridiculous. I can’t see anything. Somebody must have put my glasses somewhere.
Mummy Pig," Do you remember where you last put them, Daddy Pig?"
Daddy Pig, When I don’t wear them I always put them in my pocket. But they aren’t there now.
Peppa Pig," Daddy, can we help find your glasses?"
Mummy Pig," Good idea, Peppa. If you find them, Daddy will stop being so grumpy."
Daddy Pig, I’m not grumpy.
Narrator, Peppa and George are looking for Daddy’s glasses.

Peppa Pig, It was your brother’s fault. He broke George’s sand castle.
Rebecca Rabbit, Your brother broke my brother’s sand castle first.
Daddy Pig," Now, now. You two big girls are meant to be teaching Richard and George to play nicely together."
Rebecca Rabbit, That’s right. We’re big girls.
Peppa Pig, And George and Richard are too little to play together properly.
Mummy Pig, Hmm. I’ve got an idea.
Mummy Pig," George, what’s your most favourite thing in the whole playground?"
George, Seesaw.
Narrator, George loves the seesaw.
George, Seesaw.

Peppa Pig, Goodnight!
Narrator, Peppa and her family are going camping.
Daddy Pig, I love camping. We’re here!
Daddy Pig," Peppa, George, this is the tent I had when I was a little boy."

Daddy Pig," Don’t worry, Peppa. I’m an expert at camping! Mummy Pig, put the tent on the poles, please."
Daddy Pig, That’s it. Easy as pie!
Daddy Pig, Ooo!
Mummy Pig, Do these pegs do anything?
Daddy Pig," Of course, I forgot about the pegs."
Narrator, Pegs hold the tent up.
Daddy Pig, There.
Peppa Pig, The tent is a bit little.
Daddy Pig," It was big enough for me when I was a boy, but it does look a bit small now!"
Mummy Pig," That’s because you’ve grown a bit since you were a boy, Daddy Pig."
Peppa Pig, And your tummy has grown the most of all!
Daddy Pig," Talking of tummies, we should cook supper."
Peppa Pig," Yes, yes!"
Daddy Pig, First we have to collect sticks to make a fire.
Peppa Pig, Yippee~!
Narrator, Peppa and George are helping Daddy Pig collect sticks for the campfire.
Peppa Pig," George, I’ll pick up the sticks and you can carry them."

Daddy Pig, That’s a splendid campfire. Now I’ll light it.
Mummy Pig, Here are the matches!
Daddy Pig, We don’t need matches.
Peppa Pig," Daddy, how can you light it without matches?"
Daddy Pig, I’m going to make fire the old way. By simply rubbing these two sticks together.
Narrator, Daddy Pig is rubbing the two sticks together to light the campfire.
Peppa Pig," Where’s the fire, Daddy?"
Daddy Pig, Nearly there.
 Mummy Pig and George, Hurrah!
Daddy Pig, Easy as pie.
Mummy Pig, Now we can heat up the tomato soup.
Daddy Pig," Ah, listen to the sounds of nature."
Peppa Pig, What is that sound?
Daddy Pig, That is the sound of crickets chirping.
Peppa Pig, What is that?
Mummy Pig," That’s an owl. Look, there it is."
Peppa Pig, Wow.
Peppa Pig, And what’s that noise?
Mummy Pig," Oh, I’m not sure."
Peppa Pig, It’s Daddy’s tummy!
Daddy Pig, My tummy rumbling is one of the best sounds of nature. It means it’s time to eat.
Peppa Pig, I love tomato soup.
Daddy Pig, So do I!
Mummy Pig, There’s another one of Daddy Pig’s sounds of nature.
Daddy Pig, What?
Mummy Pig," Come on, children. Into the tent. It’s bedtime."
Peppa Pig, We won’t all fit in. The tent is too little.
Daddy Pig, It will be fine. In you go.
Daddy Pig," Move further in, Mummy Pig!"
Peppa Pig," Daddy, you’re too big for the tent."
Daddy Pig, Never mind. I’d rather sleep outside anyway!
Mummy Pig," Good night, Daddy Pig."
Peppa Pig," Good night, Daddy."
George, Night-night~!
Daddy Pig," Good night, everyone."
Narrator," Mummy Pig, Peppa and George are sleeping in the tent. Daddy Pig is sleeping outside under the stars."

Daddy Pig, Ah. I love watching telly. (Thud and bump)
Daddy Pig, What's this Mummy Pig?
Mummy Pig, (oinks) It's a programme about doing exercises to keep fit.
Daddy Pig, (chuckles) Thank goodness I don't have to exercise. I'm naturally fit.
Peppa Pig, (oinks) You don't look very fit Daddy. Your tummy is a bit big.
Daddy Pig, I'm very fit. I'll show you. (Oinks) What shall I do first?

Peppa Pig, One. Two.
Daddy Pig, There.
Peppa Pig," Very good, Daddy. Now I want you to do.... one hundred."
Daddy Pig, One hundred?
Peppa Pig, Yes.

Peppa Pig," Daddy Pig! You're cheating, you should be doing press-ups."
Daddy Pig," Oh, er, there was something interesting on the TV."
Peppa Pig, Naughty Daddy.
Mummy Pig, Maybe Daddy will have more success with my old exercise bike.
Daddy Pig, Ah ha. This looks like fun. I'll be able to cycle and watch TV at the same time. (Engine sounds)
Daddy Pig, It's impossible. This bike is too noisy. I can't hear the TV.

Mummy Pig," Yes, and then you'll get some fresh air as well."

Daddy Pig, Easy as pie. Ough. (Panting)
Narrator, Getting fit is quite hard work.

Daddy Pig, (screams) The brakes aren't strong enough! Help! (screaming)
Daddy Pig, Whoa!
Narrator, Daddy Pig has been gone for a long time.
Peppa Pig," Mummy, where can Daddy be?"
Mummy Pig," Don't worry, Peppa. Daddy must be really enjoying himself to be away for so long."
Daddy Pig," Ough, ough, hagh, egh. (Panting and tired) (The duck quacks) (bells ring)"
Peppa Pig," Daddy, Where have you been?"
Daddy Pig, I whizzed all the way down the hill. Then I had to push the bike all the way back up again.
Mummy Pig," (Gasps) Oh, poor Daddy Pig."
Daddy Pig, Well at least I've done my exercise.
Mummy Pig," Yes, for today."
Daddy Pig, What do you mean?
Mummy Pig, You have to do some more exercise tomorrow.

Daddy Pig, Oh no.
Peppa Pig," But don't worry, Daddy. I’ll make sure you do it."
Daddy Pig," Yes, I know you will. (Chuckles)"
Narrator," Daddy Pig wears glasses. He needs to wear glasses to see clearly. When Daddy Pig wears his glasses, everything looks fine. But when Daddy Pig takes his glasses off, he can’t see things clearly. Everything looks a bit soft and fuzzy. So it is very important that Daddy Pig knows where his glasses are."

Mummy Pig," Peppa, George, have you seen Daddy Pig’s glasses? He can’t find them anywhere."
Peppa Pig," No, Mummy."
Narrator, Peppa and George do not know where Daddy Pig’s glasses are.
Mummy Pig," Oh, dear. Daddy Pig cannot see a thing without them. And it makes him very grumpy."
Narrator," Without his glasses on, Daddy Pig cannot read his newspaper."
Daddy Pig, This is ridiculous. I can’t see anything. Somebody must have put my glasses somewhere.
Mummy Pig," Do you remember where you last put them, Daddy Pig?"
Daddy Pig, When I don’t wear them I always put them in my pocket. But they aren’t there now.
Peppa Pig," Daddy, can we help find your glasses?"
Mummy Pig," Good idea, Peppa. If you find them, Daddy will stop being so grumpy."
Daddy Pig, I’m not grumpy.
Narrator, Peppa and George are looking for Daddy’s glasses.
Narrator," Peppa looks under the newspaper, but Daddy Pig’s glasses are not there."
Peppa Pig, Oh.
Narrator," George looks on top of the television, but Daddy Pig’s glasses are not there."
George, Oh.
Peppa Pig, Let’s look upstairs in Mummy and Daddy’s bedroom.
Narrator, Peppa and George are looking in Mummy and Daddy Pig’s bedroom.

Peppa Pig, We’ve looked everywhere but we can’t find Daddy’s glasses.
Mummy Pig," Oh, dear. Now what can we do?"
Daddy Pig, I suppose I‘ll just have to learn to do without them. If I move slowly I won’t bump into things.
Peppa Pig, There they are. Daddy’s glasses.
Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig. You were sitting on them all the time.
Daddy Pig, Oh.
Peppa Pig, Silly Daddy.
Daddy Pig, I don’t know how they got there.

Daddy Pig," Now, now. You two big girls are meant to be teaching Richard and George to play nicely together."
Rebecca Rabbit, That’s right. We’re big girls.

Narrator, Peppa and her family are going camping.
Daddy Pig, I love camping. We’re here!

Daddy Pig, That’s it. Easy as pie!
Daddy Pig, Ooo!
Mummy Pig, Do these pegs do anything?
Daddy Pig," Of course, I forgot about the pegs."
Narrator, Pegs hold the tent up.
Daddy Pig, There.
Peppa Pig, The tent is a bit little.
Daddy Pig," It was big enough for me when I was a boy, but it does look a bit small now!"
Mummy Pig," That’s because you’ve grown a bit since you were a boy, Daddy Pig."
Peppa Pig, And your tummy has grown the most of all!

Peppa Pig," Yes, yes!"
Daddy Pig, First we have to collect sticks to make a fire.

Daddy Pig, That’s a splendid campfire. Now I’ll light it.
Mummy Pig, Here are the matches!
Daddy Pig, We don’t need matches.
Peppa Pig," Daddy, how can you light it without matches?"
Daddy Pig, I’m going to make fire the old way. By simply rubbing these two sticks together.
Narrator, Daddy Pig is rubbing the two sticks together to light the campfire.
Peppa Pig," Where’s the fire, Daddy?"
Daddy Pig, Nearly there.
 Mummy Pig and George, Hurrah!
Daddy Pig, Easy as pie.
Mummy Pig, Now we can heat up the tomato soup.
Daddy Pig," Ah, listen to the sounds of nature."
Peppa Pig, What is that sound?
Daddy Pig, That is the sound of crickets chirping.
Peppa Pig, What is that?
Mummy Pig," That’s an owl. Look, there it is."
Peppa and George, Wow.
Peppa Pig, And what’s that noise?
Mummy Pig," Oh, I’m not sure."
Peppa Pig, It’s Daddy’s tummy!
Daddy Pig, My tummy rumbling is one of the best sounds of nature. It means it’s time to eat.
Peppa Pig, I love tomato soup.
Daddy Pig, So do I!
Mummy Pig, There’s another one of Daddy Pig’s sounds of nature.
Daddy Pig, What?
Mummy Pig," Come on, children. Into the tent. It’s bedtime."
Peppa Pig, We won’t all fit in. The tent is too little.
Daddy Pig, It will be fine. In you go.
Daddy Pig," Move further in, Mummy Pig!"
Peppa Pig," Daddy, you’re too big for the tent."
Daddy Pig, Never mind. I’d rather sleep outside anyway!
Mummy Pig," Good night, Daddy Pig."
Peppa Pig," Good night, Daddy."
George, Night-night~!
Daddy Pig," Good night, everyone."
Narrator," Mummy Pig, Peppa and George are sleeping in the tent. Daddy Pig is sleeping outside under the stars."

Daddy Pig, What's this Mummy Pig?
Mummy Pig, (oinks) It's a programme about doing exercises to keep fit.
Daddy Pig, (chuckles) Thank goodness I don't have to exercise. I'm naturally fit.

Peppa Pig," Daddy Pig! You're cheating, you should be doing press-ups."
Daddy Pig," Oh, er, there was something interesting on the TV."
Peppa Pig, Naughty Daddy.
Mummy Pig, Maybe Daddy will have more success with my old exercise bike.
Daddy Pig, Ah ha. This looks like fun. I'll be able to cycle and watch TV at the same time. (Engine sounds)
Daddy Pig, It's impossible. This bike is too noisy. I can't hear the TV.

Mummy Pig," Yes, and then you'll get some fresh air as well."

Peppa Pig," Daddy, these are the pedals, these are the brakes, and this is the bell. (Bells ring)"

Daddy Pig, Easy as pie. Ough. (Panting)
Narrator, Getting fit is quite hard work.
Daddy Pig," Ahh. Oh ho, Now I can get fit without having to pedal. (Bells ringing)"
Narrator, Daddy Pig is going very fast.
Daddy Pig, Oh. Maybe I'd better slow down.
Daddy Pig, (screams) The brakes aren't strong enough! Help! (screaming)
Daddy Pig, Whoa!
Narrator, Daddy Pig has been gone for a long time.
Peppa Pig," Mummy, where can Daddy be?"
Mummy Pig," Don't worry, Peppa. Daddy must be really enjoying himself to be away for so long."
Daddy Pig," Ough, ough, hagh, egh. (Panting and tired) (The duck quacks) (bells ring)"
Peppa Pig," Daddy, Where have you been?"
Daddy Pig, I whizzed all the way down the hill. Then I had to push the bike all the way back up again.
Mummy Pig," (Gasps) Oh, poor Daddy Pig."
Daddy Pig, Well at least I've done my exercise.
Mummy Pig," Yes, for today."
Daddy Pig, What do you mean?

Daddy Pig, Oh no.
Peppa Pig," But don't worry, Daddy. I’ll make sure you do it."
Daddy Pig," Yes, I know you will. (Chuckles)"
Narrator," Daddy Pig wears glasses. He needs to wear glasses to see clearly. When Daddy Pig wears his glasses, everything looks fine. But when Daddy Pig takes his glasses off, he can’t see things clearly. Everything looks a bit soft and fuzzy. So it is very important that Daddy Pig knows where his glasses are."

Mummy Pig," Do you remember where you last put them, Daddy Pig?"
Daddy Pig, When I don’t wear them I always put them in my pocket. But they aren’t there now.
Peppa Pig," Daddy, can we help find your glasses?"
Mummy Pig," Good idea, Peppa. If you find them, Daddy will stop being so grumpy."
Daddy Pig, I’m not grumpy.
Narrator, Peppa and George are looking for Daddy’s glasses.

Peppa Pig," Oh, George. In the world, there are two sorts of balloons. The ""Up Balloon"" and the ""Down Balloon"". That is an ""Up Balloon"". (George looks confused.) If you let it go, it will go up and up and up, all the way to the moon!"
George, Moon! (He then carelessly releases the balloon and then starts to cry.)
Peppa Pig, Grandpa!
Grandpa," Oh! (He then stands on the bonnet of the car and grabs the balloon just in time) AHHHHH! Got you! (George stops crying and then giggles after Grandpa saves the balloon.) Perhaps we should go indoors before we lose your balloon, George."
Grandpa, Your Balloon will be safe in here.
Peppa Pig," (Oink!) Hello Polly, George has got a new balloon!"
Polly," (Swork!) Balloon! (Peppa and George giggle, Polly then hits the balloon with her beak.)"
Granny," Don't you pop it, Polly! (Oink!) George loves his new balloon. (George continues to laugh and bobs the balloon, only for him to release it by accident again)"
George, Oh.
Narrator, George has let go of his Balloon again!
Peppa Pig, Don't worry George. It won't fly away because the roof is in the way!
Grandpa," Don't worry. (Oink!) There's only one way out of the attic and that is through the roof window, which is always keep shut. (They head into the attic, only to notice the window is left open, as the Balloon goes through it.) Oh, Dear!"
Narrator, The roof window is not closed.
Peppa Pig," Catch it, Grandpa!"
Grandpa," I can't, Peppa! It's in the Sky!"
Peppa Pig," George, your balloon is going to the moon, you'll never see it again. (George's mouth shakes, like he is about to cry.)"
Narrator, Daddy Pig has come to take Peppa and George home.
Daddy, Hello! Have you had a lovely time? (George then cries)
Peppa Pig," But George let it go and it's flying to the moon! (A full scene of the house is shown, with the balloon still in the sky.)"
Polly, Squark! Balloon! (She then begins to fly to save the balloon.)

Polly, Who's a clever Polly? (Oink!) (Everybody laughs)
Peppa Pig," George, don't let go of your balloon, again."
Daddy," I know, we'll tie the string to your wrist, George."
Grandpa, What a good idea! (Daddy Pig then ties the string to George.)
George, (Oink Oink!) (Giggles and bobs the Balloon.)
Narrator, George loves his Dinosaur Balloon. (Everybody falls to the ground laughing) Everyone loves George's Dinosaur Balloon.

Narrator," Here is Rebecca Rabbit with her little brother, Richard Rabbit."
Rebecca Rabbit," Hello, everyone."
 Suzy Sheep and Danny Dog, Hello.
Rebecca Rabbit, Can I come on the roundabout too?
Daddy Pig," Hop on, Rebecca."
Rebecca Rabbit, Let’s go really really fast.
Narrator, Richard Rabbit wants to go on the roundabout too.
Peppa Pig," Oh, if Richard gets on, it means we can’t go fast."
Rebecca Rabbit, Richard can play with George.
Mummy Rabbit," Richard, would you like to play with George?"
Richard, No.
Mummy Rabbit, George has a dinosaur just like yours. Let’s go and see.
Narrator, Richard Rabbit is the same age as George.
Mummy Rabbit, Richard wants to see George’s dinosaur.

George, No.
Mummy Rabbit," Richard, can George play with your dinosaur?"
Richard, No.

George, (giggles)
Narrator, Richard does not like sharing either.

Peppa Pig, Of course.
Rebecca Rabbit, We can help them make sand castles.
Daddy Pig, Good idea. Let’s go to the sand pit.
Narrator, George and Richard love the sand pit.
Peppa Pig," George, Richard, today we are going to make sand castles."

Peppa Pig, Hey presto.
Narrator, Richard has made a sand castle.
George, Hey presto.
Narrator, And George has made a sand castle.
Daddy Pig," You see, playing together is fun."
Narrator," Oh, dear. This game has not gone very well."
Peppa Pig, It was your brother’s fault. He broke George’s sand castle.
Rebecca Rabbit, Your brother broke my brother’s sand castle first.
Daddy Pig," Now, now. You two big girls are meant to be teaching Richard and George to play nicely together."
Rebecca Rabbit, That’s right. We’re big girls.
Peppa Pig, And George and Richard are too little to play together properly.
Mummy Pig, Hmm. I’ve got an idea.
Mummy Pig," George, what’s your most favourite thing in the whole playground?"
George, Seesaw.
Narrator, George loves the seesaw.
George, Seesaw.
Narrator, It is a bit difficult to play on a seesaw on your own.

Peppa Pig, Duck land! Let's go to duck land!
Narrator, Peppa and George love ducks.
Peppa Pig, How do we get to duck land?

Daddy Pig, Goodnight my little piggies.
Peppa Pig, Goodnight!
Narrator, Peppa and her family are going camping.
Daddy Pig, I love camping. We’re here!
Daddy Pig," Peppa, George, this is the tent I had when I was a little boy."
Peppa Pig," Daddy, how are you going to make that into a tent?"
Daddy Pig," Don’t worry, Peppa. I’m an expert at camping! Mummy Pig, put the tent on the poles, please."
Daddy Pig, That’s it. Easy as pie!
Daddy Pig, Ooo!
Mummy Pig, Do these pegs do anything?
Daddy Pig," Of course, I forgot about the pegs."
Narrator, Pegs hold the tent up.
Daddy Pig, There.
Peppa Pig, The tent is a bit little.
Daddy Pig," It was big enough for me when I was a boy, but it does look a bit small now!"
Mummy Pig," That’s because you’ve grown a bit since you were a boy, Daddy Pig."
Peppa Pig, And your tummy has grown the most of all!
Daddy Pig," Talking of tummies, we should cook supper."
Peppa Pig," Yes, yes!"
Daddy Pig, First we have to collect sticks to make a fire.
Peppa Pig, Yippee~!
Narrator, Peppa and George are helping Daddy Pig collect sticks for the campfire.
Peppa Pig," George, I’ll pick up the sticks and you can carry them."
Peppa Pig, Collecting sticks is fun!
Daddy Pig," Good, that’s enough sticks."
Daddy Pig, That’s a splendid campfire. Now I’ll light it.
Mummy Pig, Here are the matches!
Daddy Pig, We don’t need matches.
Peppa Pig," Daddy, how can you light it without matches?"
Daddy Pig, I’m going to make fire the old way. By simply rubbing these two sticks together.
Narrator, Daddy Pig is rubbing the two sticks together to light the campfire.
Peppa Pig," Where’s the fire, Daddy?"
Daddy Pig, Nearly there.
 Mummy Pig and George, Hurrah!
Daddy Pig, Easy as pie.
Mummy Pig, Now we can heat up the tomato soup.
Daddy Pig," Ah, listen to the sounds of nature."
Peppa Pig, What is that sound?
Daddy Pig, That is the sound of crickets chirping.
Peppa Pig, What is that?
Mummy Pig," That’s an owl. Look, there it is."
Peppa Pig, Wow.
Peppa Pig, And what’s that noise?
Mummy Pig," Oh, I’m not sure."
Peppa Pig, It’s Daddy’s tummy!
Daddy Pig, My tummy rumbling is one of the best sounds of nature. It means it’s time to eat.
Peppa Pig, I love tomato soup.
Daddy Pig, So do I!
Mummy Pig, There’s another one of Daddy Pig’s sounds of nature.
Daddy Pig, What?
Mummy Pig," Come on, children. Into the tent. It’s bedtime."
Peppa Pig, We won’t all fit in. The tent is too little.
Daddy Pig, It will be fine. In you go.
Daddy Pig," Move further in, Mummy Pig!"
Peppa Pig," Daddy, you’re too big for the tent."
Daddy Pig, Never mind. I’d rather sleep outside anyway!
Mummy Pig," Good night, Daddy Pig."
Peppa Pig," Good night, Daddy."
George, Night-night~!
Daddy Pig," Good night, everyone."
Narrator," Mummy Pig, Peppa and George are sleeping in the tent. Daddy Pig is sleeping outside under the stars."

Peppa Pig," Daddy, it was lovely and cosy in the tent. Oh, where’s Daddy?"
Narrator, Daddy Pig has gone.
Mummy Pig, Poor Daddy Pig. He must have been cold and wet! And now where is he?
Mummy Pig, What’s that sound?
Peppa Pig, It sounds like snoring...
Peppa Pig, Daddy Pig!
Daddy Pig, What?
Peppa Pig," Daddy, you’re safe!"

Daddy Pig, Ah. I love watching telly. (Thud and bump)
Daddy Pig, What's this Mummy Pig?
Mummy Pig, (oinks) It's a programme about doing exercises to keep fit.
Daddy Pig, (chuckles) Thank goodness I don't have to exercise. I'm naturally fit.
Peppa Pig, (oinks) You don't look very fit Daddy. Your tummy is a bit big.
Daddy Pig, I'm very fit. I'll show you. (Oinks) What shall I do first?
Peppa Pig, Touch your toes like this.

Mummy Pig," Daddy Pig, you have to start exercising now."
Daddy Pig, Oh.
Peppa Pig, Don't worry Daddy. I will help you.
Daddy Pig," Oh, all right."
Daddy Pig," Peppa, you're in charge of getting me fit. What shall I do first?"
Peppa Pig, First you must do some press-ups.
Daddy Pig, (oinks) Easy.
Peppa Pig, One. Two.
Daddy Pig, There.
Peppa Pig," Very good, Daddy. Now I want you to do.... one hundred."
Daddy Pig, One hundred?
Peppa Pig, Yes.
Mummy Pig," Come on, children. Help me make lunch."
Daddy Pig, I'll help as well.
Peppa Pig," No, Daddy. You've got one hundred press-ups to do."
Daddy Pig," Oh. One, two... 3, 4..."
Narrator," Mummy Pig, Peppa and George are in the kitchen making lunch. Daddy pig: 5...."
Daddy Pig, Six...
Narrator, Daddy Pig is still doing his press-ups. Daddy pig: 7....
Daddy Pig, Eight...
Peppa Pig, Daddy is doing very well.
Daddy Pig, 9...
Daddy Pig, Ten...
Mummy Pig," Yes, I do hope he's not overdoing it. Daddy pig: 11... 12..."
Peppa Pig, I'll go and see.
Daddy Pig," Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen."
Peppa Pig," Daddy Pig! You're cheating, you should be doing press-ups."
Daddy Pig," Oh, er, there was something interesting on the TV."
Peppa Pig, Naughty Daddy.
Mummy Pig, Maybe Daddy will have more success with my old exercise bike.
Daddy Pig, Ah ha. This looks like fun. I'll be able to cycle and watch TV at the same time. (Engine sounds)
Daddy Pig, It's impossible. This bike is too noisy. I can't hear the TV.
Mummy Pig, (oinks) You've got to get fit somehow.
Peppa Pig," I know, you can use my bicycle."
Mummy Pig," Yes, and then you'll get some fresh air as well."
Narrator, Daddy Pig is going to ride on Peppa's little bicycle.
Peppa Pig," Daddy, these are the pedals, these are the brakes, and this is the bell. (Bells ring)"
Daddy Pig," Yes, yes, thank you, Peppa. I know. (Oinks) Bye-bye. (Bells ring)"
Daddy Pig, Easy as pie. Ough. (Panting)
Narrator, Getting fit is quite hard work.
Daddy Pig," Ahh. Oh ho, Now I can get fit without having to pedal. (Bells ringing)"
Narrator, Daddy Pig is going very fast.
Daddy Pig, Oh. Maybe I'd better slow down.
Daddy Pig, (screams) The brakes aren't strong enough! Help! (screaming)
Daddy Pig, Whoa!
Narrator, Daddy Pig has been gone for a long time.
Peppa Pig," Mummy, where can Daddy be?"
Mummy Pig," Don't worry, Peppa. Daddy must be really enjoying himself to be away for so long."
Daddy Pig," Ough, ough, hagh, egh. (Panting and tired) (The duck quacks) (bells ring)"
Peppa Pig," Daddy, Where have you been?"
Daddy Pig, I whizzed all the way down the hill. Then I had to push the bike all the way back up again.
Mummy Pig," (Gasps) Oh, poor Daddy Pig."
Daddy Pig, Well at least I've done my exercise.
Mummy Pig," Yes, for today."
Daddy Pig, What do you mean?
Mummy Pig, You have to do some more exercise tomorrow.
Daddy Pig, What?
Peppa Pig," Daddy, to get fit, you have to exercise every day."
Daddy Pig, Oh no.
Peppa Pig," But don't worry, Daddy. I’ll make sure you do it."
Daddy Pig," Yes, I know you will. (Chuckles)"
Narrator," Daddy Pig wears glasses. He needs to wear glasses to see clearly. When Daddy Pig wears his glasses, everything looks fine. But when Daddy Pig takes his glasses off, he can’t see things clearly. Everything looks a bit soft and fuzzy. So it is very important that Daddy Pig knows where his glasses are."
Narrator, Sometimes Daddy Pig loses his glasses.
Mummy Pig," Peppa, George, have you seen Daddy Pig’s glasses? He can’t find them anywhere."
Peppa Pig," No, Mummy."
Narrator, Peppa and George do not know where Daddy Pig’s glasses are.
Mummy Pig," Oh, dear. Daddy Pig cannot see a thing without them. And it makes him very grumpy."
Narrator," Without his glasses on, Daddy Pig cannot read his newspaper."
Daddy Pig, This is ridiculous. I can’t see anything. Somebody must have put my glasses somewhere.
Mummy Pig," Do you remember where you last put them, Daddy Pig?"
Daddy Pig, When I don’t wear them I always put them in my pocket. But they aren’t there now.
Peppa Pig," Daddy, can we help find your glasses?"
Mummy Pig," Good idea, Peppa. If you find them, Daddy will stop being so grumpy."
Daddy Pig, I’m not grumpy.
Narrator, Peppa and George are looking for Daddy’s glasses.
Narrator," Peppa looks under the newspaper, but Daddy Pig’s glasses are not there."
Peppa Pig, Oh.
Narrator," George looks on top of the television, but Daddy Pig’s glasses are not there."
George, Oh.
Peppa Pig, Let’s look upstairs in Mummy and Daddy’s bedroom.
Narrator, Peppa and George are looking in Mummy and Daddy Pig’s bedroom.

Peppa Pig, We’ve looked everywhere but we can’t find Daddy’s glasses.
Mummy Pig," Oh, dear. Now what can we do?"
Daddy Pig, I suppose I‘ll just have to learn to do without them. If I move slowly I won’t bump into things.
Peppa Pig, There they are. Daddy’s glasses.
Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig. You were sitting on them all the time.
Daddy Pig, Oh.
Peppa Pig, Silly Daddy.
Daddy Pig, I don’t know how they got there.

Peppa Pig, Oh. We only play catch because George likes it.
Peppa Pig, Proper rules.
Narrator, Peppa is it. She has to chase Chloé and George.
Peppa Pig," George, I’m going to easily catch you. You’re so little."
Peppa Pig, That’s not fair. You’re helping George.
Peppa Pig, No. I don’t need help. I’m a big girl like you.
Peppa Pig, This is a silly game. Can we play something else?
Peppa Pig, Sly Fox! I want to play Sly Fox. What is it?
Peppa Pig," Me, me! I want to be the sly fox."
Narrator," Peppa is the sly fox. While her back is turned, the others creep up on her. But if Peppa turns and sees someone move, they have to go back to the start."
Peppa Pig," George, I saw you move. Back to the start."
Peppa Pig, You moved before I was ready.
Narrator, Now it’s Chloé’s turn to be the sly fox.
Narrator, Peppa and George must stay very still.
Peppa Pig, It’s not fair. You looked too long.

Peppa Pig, Can we play a different game?
Peppa Pig, I know. Let’s play my favourite game. It’s very grown-up.
Narrator, Peppa’s favourite game is jumping up and down in muddy puddles.
Peppa Pig," George, if you jump in puddles, you must wear your boots. I’ve brought some boots for you too, Chloé."
Peppa Pig, Oh. So am I.
